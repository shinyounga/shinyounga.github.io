## About Me

I am a Master student in the Smart Infrastructure Laboratory at Yonsei University, advised by Professor Hongjo Kim. My research focuses on applying artificial intelligence and deep learning to construction engineering challenges, with particular interests in:

- AI-based sensing platforms for levee failure prediction  
- Water level prediction models for ungauged basins
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in construction domain  
- Object detection and segmentation of PPE in construction site images
